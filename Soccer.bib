Using NHL regular-season data from 2005–2010, we identify four forward types, four defensemen types, and three goalie types. Goalies tend to contribute the most to team performance, followed by forwards and then defensemen. We also show that once we account for salary cap and playing-time information, the value of different player types may become similar. Lastly, we illustrate how to use the regression results to analyze trades and their impact on team performance. },

  abstract  = {Abstract
1. Despite large investments of public funds into environmental flows programs, we
have little ability to make quantitative predictions of the ecological benefits of
restored flow regimes. Rather, ecological predictions in environmental flow
assessments typically have been qualitative and based largely upon expert opinion. Widely applicable, quantitative models would help to justify existing flow
programs and to inform future planning.
2. Here, we used a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of monitoring data coupled with
expert-derived prior distributions, to develop such a model. We quantified the
relationship between the duration and frequency of inundation, and encroachment of terrestrial vegetation into regulated river channels. The analysis was
informed by data from 27 sites on seven rivers.
3. We found that longer inundation durations reduce terrestrial vegetation
encroachment. For example, a 50-day continuous inundation during winter
reduced predicted vegetation cover to a median of 11% (95% CI: 7%–35%) of
cover predicted under non-inundated conditions. This effect varied among sites
and rivers, and was moderated by the frequency of inundation events.
4. The hierarchical structure improved precision of model predictions relative to
simpler analysis structures. Informative prior distributions also improved precision
relative to minimally informative priors.
5. The hierarchical Bayesian analysis allows us to make quantitative predictions of
ecological response under the full range of flow conditions, allowing us to assess
the benefits of planned or delivered environmental flows. It can be used to make
estimates of ecological effects at sites that have not been sampled, and also to
scale up site-level results to catchment and regional scales. Quantitative predictions of ecological effects provide a more objective risk-based approach, allowing
improved planning of environmental flows and building public confidence in
these major investments of public funds.

  abstract = { The difference in difference (DID) design is a quasi-experimental research design that researchers often use to study causal relationships in public health settings where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are infeasible or unethical. However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method’s assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.

  abstract = {How important is home advantage in football? It is a question that has been discussed in pubs and bars down the years to great lengths, while also providing the basis for entire fields of academic research.

It's importance is factored into draws for competitions, for example, with the Champions League deciding that a second leg at home is favourable to playing away with the result still in the balance. Just a quick look at a detailed table of league results, meanwhile, will show clearly the disparity of performance.

Whether it be the familiar surroundings, the backing of a vociferous home crowd or the lack of traveling involved, there is a clear benefit to hosting a football match. Indeed, it is an advantage that can be seen from the relative success of host nations at major tournaments over the years.},

  abstract  = {This study aimed to examine the influence of level of competition (amateur, semi-professional and professional) on the magnitude of home advantage (HA) in Portuguese football, and to verify whether the HA has changed over time. Archival data from 32,400 matches contested in the three levels of competition over 11 seasons (from 2005/2006 to 2015/2016) were analysed. HA was quantified each season for each league as the number of points won at home expressed as a percentage of all points won at home and away. The mean values of HA were significantly greater than 50% in all levels of Portuguese football (p < .001). One-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of competitive level on HA (p < .05). In the professional league, the HA was significantly lower (58.31%) than in amateur and semi-professional competitive levels (60.36 and 60.46%, respectively). Altogether, a declining HA effect was found in Portuguese football in recent years. However, negative linear relationships between HA and time were only significant at amateur and semi-professional levels (p < .05), while the decline in the major professional league has already started to level off. These findings demonstrate that the advantage of playing at home is losing importance in Portugal. The declining effect of HA, previously evidenced in major professional leagues, has been mirrored by a similar decline at amateur and semi-professional levels within the country. Future research should confirm whether the trends identified in Portugal are also verified in football leagues of other countries.},

Home advantage was greatest in Africa and South America where the home team won just over 69% of all points earned; it was lowest in Europe (56%). Bolivia was the country with the greatest home advantage. Using each of the 2040 games as the observational units, a general linear model produced a significant fit to the data (R2 = 0.326), home points being the dependent variable, with a set of factors believed to influence home advantage as predictor variables. After controlling for team strength and allowing for the effects of other variables in the model, home points were significantly related to altitude of the home stadium, crowd size and number of time zones crossed by the visiting team (all p < 0.05). There was no significant effect for distance travelled by the away team, the existence of a running track or crowd density. Referees, especially in Africa, issued red cards and awarded penalties against the away team significantly more often than against the home team.

Data were examined using the autocorrelation function and linear regression analysis. Ball possession (p < .01), successful passes (p < .05), short passes (p < .01) and touches (p < .01) achieved their greatest values in the 0–5 min period compared with other match periods. However, as the first half went on, the home teams exhibited lower performances compared with those shown at the beginning of the match. This was particularly evident from the 16–20 min period until the end of the first half. This transient effect was enhanced or attenuated, depending on the quality of the opponent (p < .01). The better the opponent the lower the home teams’ performances at the beginning of the match. These variables can be used to develop a model to simulate team performance of home and away teams during the first half of a match.

  abstract  = {Officiating bias is thought to contribute to home advantage. Recent research has shown that sports with subjective officiating tend to experience greater home advantage and that referees' decisions can be influenced by crowd noise, but little work has been done to examine whether individual referees vary in their home bias or whether biased decisions contribute to overall home advantage. We develop an ordinal regression model to determine whether various measures of home advantage are affected by the official for the match and by crowd size while controlling for team ability. We examine 5244 English Premier League (EPL) match results involving 50 referees and find that home bias differs between referees. Individual referees give significantly different levels of home advantage, measured as goal differential between the home and away teams, although the significance of this result depends on one referee with a particularly high home advantage (an outlier). Referees vary significantly and robustly in their yellow card and penalty differentials even excluding the outlier. These results confirm that referees are responsible for some of the observed home advantage in the EPL and suggest that home advantage is dependent on the subjective decisions of referees that vary between individuals. We hypothesize that individual referees respond differently to factors such as crowd noise and suggest further research looking at referees' psychological and behavioural responses to biased crowds.},

  abstract  = {Many of the factors identified as influencing the home advantage have an underlying social basis, presumably through the influence exerted by the home crowd. Beliefs in the home advantage and the causes of that advantage also have a social basis: sports coverage and fan discourse focus on some aspects of the phenomenon at the expense of others. This paper compares home advantage research with the use of the concept in media narratives and fan Intemet postings. While there are many similarities across sources, the findings suggest three major differences. Fans, and to a lesser extent the media, (1) focus almost exclusively on winning as the evidence for a home advantage, (2) see crowd noise as the main factor for the home advantage, and (3) treat the phenomenon as much more transient than is suggested by academic studies. I identify several features of the phenomenon that facilitate popular views of the home advantage and suggest how future research may benefit from incorporating those views.

  abstract  = {The home advantage is a widely acknowledged sporting phenomenon, especially in association football. Here, we examine the second leg home advantage, an effect that is discussed in the public domain but which has received very little scientific attention. The second leg home advantage effect occurs when on average teams are more likely to win a two-stage knock-out competition when they play at home in the second leg. That is, both teams have a home advantage but this advantage is significantly greater for the team that plays at home second. Examining data from three different European Cup football competitions spanning 51 years, we show that the second leg home advantage is a real phenomenon. The second leg home team has more than a 50% probability to qualify for the next round in the competition even after controlling for extra time and team ability as possible alternative explanations. The second leg home advantage appears, however, to have decreased significantly over the past decade. Possible reasons for its existence and subsequent decline are presented.

  abstract  = {Home advantage is well documented in a wide range of team sports including association football (soccer). Home team crowd support has been shown to be a likely causal factor and its influence on referee decision-making appears to play a significant role. Match data from the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League and Europa League were used to investigate referee bias in terms of the association between match location (home vs. away) and disciplinary sanctions used by football referees. The adjusted mean number of yellow cards received by home and away teams and the ratios of these means were estimated from Poisson regression models. After controlling for within-match measures of attacking dominance referees in the Champions League and Europa League issued 25% (p<0.001) and 10% (p=0.002) more yellow cards, respectively, to away teams than to home teams. The higher level of home team bias in the Champions League appeared to be mainly due to higher crowd densities. In a combined analysis of both UEFA leagues the magnitude of referee bias increased with increasing crowd density (p<0.001). Crowd size and crowd proximity were not associated with referee bias after controlling for crowd density. These results provide further evidence that crowd support influences referee decisions. Failure to control for within-match team performance may over-estimate the extent of referee bias in terms of the number of disciplinary sanctions used.

  abstract  = {Using the results from the end‐of‐season (1992–93) league tables, overall home advantage was confirmed in the eight major divisions of the English and Scottish football leagues. The degree of home advantage was found to vary significantly across the divisions. Furthermore, these divisional differences in home advantage were found to be significantly associated with the mean attendance of each division. In an attempt to understand these findings, every occurrence of two influential events (either a sending‐off or penalty scored) reported in a national Sunday newspaper was recorded. The overall frequency of both sendings‐off and penalties scored favoured the home side, but again this was not constant across the divisions. In divisions with large crowds, the percentage of home sendings‐off was relatively small (30%), compared with no difference (50%) in divisions with smaller crowds. Similarly, the percentage of penalties scored by home sides in divisions with the largest crowds was large (> 70%), in contrast to little or no advantage in divisions with smaller crowds. Two possible explanations for these findings were proposed. Either larger crowds were able to provoke the away player into more reckless behaviour (real fouls), or influence the referee into believing that the away player had committed more fouls (perceived fouls).

Soccer coaches (N = 297) with different expertise levels participated in an experimental, online management game and were randomly assigned to one of two groups, “home game (HG)” or “away game.” Participants received information on the game for which they were asked to make decisions in multiple points.
