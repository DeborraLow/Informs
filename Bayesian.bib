  abstract  = {In light of recent concerns about reproducibility and replicability, the ASA issued a Statement on Statistical Significance and p-values aimed at those who are not primarily statisticians. While the ASA Statement notes that statistical significance and p-values are “commonly misused and misinterpreted,” it does not discuss and document broader implications of these errors for the interpretation of evidence. In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance. We discuss implications and offer recommendations.

HLM hypothesis testing is performed in the third section. Finally, the fourth section provides a practical example of running HLM, with which readers can follow along. Throughout this tutorial, emphasis is placed on providing a straightforward overview of the basic principles of HLM.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we provide a tutorial exposition on the Bayesian approach in analyzing structural equation models (SEMs). SEMs, which can be regarded as regression models with observed and latent variables, have been widely applied to substantive research. However, the classical methods and most commercial software in this area are based on the covariance structure approach, which would encounter serious difficulties when dealing with complicated models and/or data structures. In contrast, the Bayesian approach has much more flexibility in handling complex situations. We give a brief introduction to SEMs and a detailed description of how to apply the Bayesian approach to this kind of model. Advantages of the Bayesian approach are discussed, and results obtained from a simulation study are provided for illustration. The intended audience is statisticians/methodologists who either know about SEMs or simple Bayesian statistics, and Ph.D. students in statistics, psychometrics, or mathematical psychology.},
