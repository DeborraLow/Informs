    abstract = { Abstract Meteorologists often interpret the value of a probabilistic weather forecast using the binary cost–loss scenario. The socioeconomic benefit of such a forecast will depend on the compliance rate of users and, hence, the number of warnings that are not followed by the corresponding high-impact weather. A modified version of the canonical binary cost–loss problem in which the compliance rate of users is a function of the warning probability threshold, and hence of the “false alarm rate”, is presented. In this version of the problem, the value of the forecast can be enhanced by choosing a probability warning threshold that is higher than the cost–loss ratio. It is found that the advantage of modifying the probability warning threshold is greatest when the frequency of highly confident forecasts of an event is relatively high and when users are moderately intolerant of false alarms. Using this simple example it is illustrated that forecasters who issue nonprobabilistic, or “unequivocal,” forecasts are making implicit assumptions about the false alarm intolerance of users, as well as assumptions about their cost– loss ratios. Adopting a probabilistic approach to forecasting avoids these assumptions and separates the activity of forecasting from the activity of decision making. }

It is a continual threat, and the risk of this attack is mostly on social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+. In this paper, a dynamic approach based on minimum time to detect Phishing URL by using classification technique is described. This approach is based on different parameters such as high accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specification, and many more. The analysis result of these algorithms shows that Random tree is a good classification technique with comparison to others; it takes very less training build data time.},

  abstract  = {In today's time, phishy website detection is one of the important challenges in the field of information security due to the large numbers of online transactions going through over the websites. Website phishing means stealing one's personal information over the Internet such as system backup data, user login credentials, bank account details or other security information. Phishing means creation of phishy or fake websites which look like legitimate ones. In this research paper, we use the associative classification data mining approach that is also named as rule-based classification technique by which we can detect a phishy website and thereby identifying the better detection algorithm which has a higher accuracy detection rate. The algorithms used are Na{\"i}ve Bayes and PART algorithms of associative classification data mining approach. Moreover, we classify the websites into a legitimate website or a phishy website from the collected datasets of websites. The implementation will be done on the datasets of 1,353 websites which contain phishy sites as well as legitimate sites. At the end, results will show us the higher accuracy detection rate algorithm, which will more correctly identify phishing or legitimate websites.},

  abstract  = {Using the right decision frame, in the sense of selecting the right decision situation to analyze, is regarded as a critical part of a decision analysis effort, but there are few guidelines on how to systematically generate alternative decision situations and how to select the best one. In practice, the decision situation is typically not explicitly selected, or even well defined, which easily leads to deciding about treating symptoms instead of underlying causes; to deciding with a narrow scope that misses important elements; and, in general, to missing the opportunity of analyzing valuable alternative decision situations.
This paper presents several distinctions and three approaches for generating significantly different decision situations and selecting the one that is best for the decision maker’s current priorities and circumstances. A key element of this work is treating the selection of the decision situation as a decision in its own right and using decision analysis tools to generate a rich set of alternative decision situations and gain clarity on which element of the set is most valuable to analyze.},

  abstract  = {Female carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic mutation face significantly elevated risks of cancer, with 45%–65% of women developing breast cancer and 15%–39% developing ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. Prophylactic surgery options to reduce cancer risk include a bilateral mastectomy (BM), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), or both surgeries. No comprehensive model providing recommendations at which age to perform the surgeries to optimize quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) exists. Using available clinical data, we develop a Markov decision process model of a mutation carrier’s health states and corresponding transitions, including age-dependent breast and ovarian cancer risk, distribution of each cancer subtype and stage, and mortality. We convert the problem to a linear program to solve for the optimal surgery sequence that maximizes the carrier’s expected lifetime QALYs under varying assumptions about individual patient preferences on postsurgery quality of life, fertility considerations, advances in cancer screening or treatment, and others. Baseline results demonstrate that a QALY-maximizing sequence recommends BM between ages 30 and 60 and BSO after age 40. Surgeries are recommended later for BRCA2 mutation carriers, given their lower risk for both cancers compared to BRCA1 mutation carriers. We derive structural properties from the model and show that when a carrier has already undergone one surgery, there exists an optimal control limit beyond which performing the other surgery is always QALY maximizing.

  abstract  = {Decision analysis has been used to help solve numerous complex decisions over the last few decades. However, its power as a basis for structuring one's thinking to resolve decisions has barely been tapped. To realize this potential, we in the decision analysis community must train people to think about their decisions using the concepts and principles of decision analysis. In this process, more emphasis must be placed on structuring decisions worth thinking about, and less emphasis must be placed on analyzing structured decisions. This paper outlines what we should do to train people to be better decision makers and why this is important. It includes a description of what we must learn to do this effectively.

However, this technique has several difficulties in terms of time wasted and the availability of experts. In this article, an algorithm that simplifies structuring neural network classification models is proposed. The algorithm aims at creating a large enough structure to learn models from the training dataset that can be generalised on the testing dataset. Our algorithm dynamically tunes the structure parameters during the training phase aiming to derive accurate non-overfitting classifiers. The proposed algorithm has been applied to phishing website classification problem and it shows competitive results with respect to various evaluation measures such as harmonic mean (F1-score), precision, and classification accuracy.},
