  abstract = { The proliferation of advances in technology and communication have led to the formation of “big data” research and the argument that big data will be effective in connecting consumer to practitioners. We argue big data is also an effective means through which practitioners and academics can connect. Practitioner-academic collaborative on big data collection and advanced analysis offers a unique opportunity to align common goals between practitioners and academics, and bridge the academic-practice gap in marketing and management domains, among others. },
