This brings about a new ‘culture’ of statistical modelling that bears considerable potential for the social scientist. This argument is illustrated with a brief discussion of model-based recursive partitioning which can bridge the theory and data-driven approach. Such a method is an example of how this new approach can help revise models that work for the full dataset: it can be used for evaluating different models, a traditional weakness of the ‘traditional’ statistical approach used in social science. },

  abstract    = {Structural Equation Models (SEMs) are routinely used in the analysis of empirical data by researchers spanning different scientific fields such as psychologists or econometricians. In some fields, such as in ecology, SEMs have only started recently to attract attention and thanks to dedicated software packages the use of SEMs have steadily increased. Yet, common analysis practices in such fields that might be transposed from other statistical techniques such as model acceptance or rejection based on p value screening might be poorly fitted for SEMs. In this simulation study, SEMs were fitted via two commonly used R packages: lavaan and piecewiseSEM. Datasets were simulated under different modelling scenarios to test the impact of sample size and model complexity on various global and local model fitness indices. The results showed that not one single model indices should be used to decide on model fitness but rather a combination of different model fitness indices is needed. The global chi square test for lavaan or the Fisher C statistic are, in isolation, poor indicators of model fitness. Combining the different metrics explored here provided little safeguards against model overfitting, this emphasizes the need to cautiously interpret the inferred (causal) relations from fitted SEMs. Researchers in scientific fields with little experience in SEMs, such as in ecology, should consider and accept these limitations.},

We argue that the increasingly computational nature of social science is beginning to reverse this traditional bias against prediction; however, it has also highlighted three important issues that require resolution. First, current practices for evaluating predictions must be better standardized. Second, theoretical limits to predictive accuracy in complex social systems must be better characterized, thereby setting expectations for what can be predicted or explained. Third, predictive accuracy and interpretability must be recognized as complements, not substitutes, when evaluating explanations. Resolving these three issues will lead to better, more replicable, and more useful social science.},

Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.},

  abstract  = {Sociologists have long advocated a sociological approach to explanation by contrasting it with common sense. The argument of this article, however, is that sociologists rely on common sense more than they realize. Moreover, this unacknowledged reliance causes serious problems for their explanations of social action, that is, for why people do what they do. Many such explanations, it is argued, conflate understandability with causality in ways that are not valid by the standards of scientific explanation. It follows that if sociologists want their explanations to be scientifically valid, they must evaluate them specifically on those grounds--in particular, by forcing them to make predictions. In becoming more scientific, however, it is predicted that sociologists' explanations will also become less satisfying from an intuitive, sense-making perspective. Even as novel sources of data and improved methods open exciting new directions for sociological research, therefore, sociologists will increasingly have to choose between unsatisfying scientific explanations and satisfying but unscientific stories.},

  abstract    = {We propose generalized random forests, a method for non-parametric statistical estimation based on random forests (Breiman, 2001) that can be used to fit any quantity of interest identified as the solution to a set of local moment equations. Following the literature on local maximum likelihood estimation, our method operates at a particular point in covariate space by considering a weighted set of nearby training examples; however, instead of using classical kernel weighting functions that are prone to a strong curse of dimensionality, we use an adaptive weighting function derived from a forest designed to express heterogeneity in the specified quantity of interest. We propose a flexible, computationally efficient algorithm for growing generalized random forests, develop a large sample theory for our method showing that our estimates are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian, and provide an estimator for their asymptotic variance that enables valid confidence intervals. We use our approach to develop new methods for three statistical tasks: non-parametric quantile regression, conditional average partial effect estimation, and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation via instrumental variables. A software implementation, grf for R and C++, is available from CRAN.},

Although carefully studied by Dempster and Schatzoff, the stochastic aspect of p values is often neglected. In this expository note we borrow from Dempster and Schatzoff to rekindle interest in—and explore the potential usefulness of—understanding the stochastic behavior of p values. We relate the expected p value (EPV) under the alternative to the more familiar concepts of significance level and power. We then go on to argue that in cases where it is difficult to evaluate the power function, the EPV can be used as a measure of the performance of a test. EPV's are always easily evaluated or simulated. Different test statistics for the same hypotheses can also be compared by means of EPV's. We carry out such a comparison between the two-sample, one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and t tests, for a variety of underlying distributions. The EPV can also be a valuable tool in sample size determination and in the interpretation of observed p values. We hope to convince practitioners of the usefulness of EPV's.

The data held by private companies holds vast potential to further this mission. Yet, because of its interaction with highly politicized issues, customer privacy, proprietary content, and differing goals of firms and academics, these data are often inaccessible to university researchers. We propose here a new model for industry-academic partnerships that addresses these problems via a novel organizational structure: Respected scholars form a commission which, as a trusted third party, receives access to all relevant firm information and systems, and then recruits independent academics to do research in specific areas following standard peer review protocols organized and funded by nonprofit foundations. We also report on a partnership we helped forge under this model to make data available about the extremely visible and highly politicized issues surrounding the impact of social media on elections and democracy. In our partnership, Facebook will provide privacy-preserving data and access; seven major politically and substantively diverse nonprofit foundations will fund the research; and the Social Science Research Council will oversee the peer review process for funding and data access.},
